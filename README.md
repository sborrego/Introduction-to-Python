## Software Installation

We will program in Python using JupyterLab, a programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-to-date web browser - Chrome, Safari and Firefox are all supported.

#### Python

There are two current versions of Python -- we will be using version 3.5 or later. 

Download Python 3.x - [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

#### JupyterLab

Install JupyterLab - [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)

#### Alternative Installation - Anaconda

While downloading Python and JupyterLab should not be too difficult, using Anaconda can make installation and use simpler. Anacoda is an all-in-one installer, provides a user-friendly interface, and allows easy access to Python packages.
